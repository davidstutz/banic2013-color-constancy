# Color Sparrow Fork

This is a fork of the "Color Sparrow" color constancy algorithm as described in [1] and available at [http://www.fer.unizg.hr/ipg/resources/color_constancy](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/ipg/resources/color_constancy).

The original README can be found below.

## Original README

Color Sparrow is a simple auto white balancing program for removing the color cast of the scene illumination source from a given image. It assumes uniform scene illumination and performs global illumination estimation and after that chromatically adapts the image. The illumination estimation is based on the paper mentioned in the Literature section.

The program needs OpenCV library for image reading and simple processing. For compilation on Linux, the program also needs pkg-config.

### Version
